Satellite imagery are used for ecological and social observation, and there are lists of publicly available datasets online. [Here](https://github.com/chrieke/awesome-satellite-imagery-datasets) is one. For a satellite imagery dataset about food security specifically, consider this [competition](https://app.wandb.ai/wandb/droughtwatch/benchmark).

This [competition](http://drivendata.co/case-studies/promoting-digital-financial-services-in-tanzania/) describes an attempt to use mobile money effort to improve financial inclusion and resilience.

Improved disease surveillance and response is an important part of adaptation -- here is one [competition](https://zindi.africa/competitions/ibm-malaria-challenge) with this goal in mind.
